# ScopeLite

- This project was just a experimental proof of concept, that you can do audio visualization on realtime.
- Usable on Windows and Linux, Mac untested
- This project is abandoned, I am programming a new, improved one.
- Source code is not readable

To start this application in Linux, use:

```sh
java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=True -jar ScopeLite.jar
```
Also you might want to change input from the:
```sh
pavucontrol
```
to put this application to read from monitor, instead from your microphone.
